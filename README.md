# Metagenomics-Analyses
This is a collection of 16S rRNA metagenomics analyses. One project was to anlayze the microbial community in a sinkhole and the other was to look at the microbiome of dolphin skins that had an unusual deadly skin disease. For both projects I generated 16S rRNA metabarcoding data and used the code int his reposity to analyze the diversity of prokaryotes present.
